# Country and Weather

A simple react aplication in which we can search for details of a country and also the weather in the caplital city of that country. I am using the API from [Rest Countries](https://restcountries.eu//) to get the country details and [WeatherStack](https://weatherstack.com/) for weather details. 

The WeatherStack API is a HTTP request,hence the weather details wont be displayed unless we allow [https://country-capital-weather.herokuapp.com/](https://country-capital-weather.herokuapp.com/) to show insecure content in the settings.


### Setup

To set up this application open your terminal and run the following command.
```
npm install
npm start

```
The above command will install all the necessary packages and run the appliation.
